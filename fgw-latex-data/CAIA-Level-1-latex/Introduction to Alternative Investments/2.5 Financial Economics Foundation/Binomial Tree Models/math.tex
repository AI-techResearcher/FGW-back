APPLICATION A

A stock currently selling for $\$ 10$ will either rise to $\$ 30$ or fall to $\$ 0$ in three months. How much would a three-month call sell for if its strike price were $\$ 20$ ?

Answer and Explanation

The key piece to understand in this application is that the payoff of the call $(\$ 10$ or $\$ 30-\$ 20)$ is $1 / 3(\$ 10 / \$ 30)$ of the ending stock price of $\$ 30$.

To solve this application, we need to find the payoff of the call by subtracting the future stock price of $\$ 30$ by the strike price of $\$ 20$ for a difference of $\$ 10$. Then divide $\$ 10$ (pay off the call) by $\$ 30$ (future stock price), which equals $1 / 3$. Then multiply the $1 / 3$ by $\$ 10$ (current stock price) for a product of $\$ 3.33$, which is the price of the call.
