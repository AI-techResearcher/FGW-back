\section*{APPLICATION A}
The notional value of a derivative contract is / times the amount of collateral required to fund a position in the derivative. If $R$ is the non-annualized return of the derivative based on its notional value and $R_{f}$ is the continuously compounded return on the riskless asset, what is the non-annualized log return of the collateralized position, assuming that the position is fully levered?

\section*{Answer and Explanation}
$$
l=3, R=6 \%, \text { and } R_{f}=3 \%
$$

To solve this, we must use Equation 2:

$$
\begin{gathered}
R_{\text {poll }}=[l \times \ln (1+R)]+R_{f} \\
R_{\text {poll }}=[3 \times \ln (1+0.06)]+0.03 \\
R_{\text {pcoll }}=0.2048
\end{gathered}
$$

The non-annualized log return of the collateralized position is $20.48 \%$
