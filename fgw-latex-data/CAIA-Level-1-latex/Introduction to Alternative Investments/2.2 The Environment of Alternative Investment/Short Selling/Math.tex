\section*{APPLICATION A}
Suppose that a short seller establishes a short position in one share of XYZ Corporation at $\$ 100$ per share and that XYZ pays a dividend of $\$ 1.00$ per share each year. The current rebate on XYZ shares is $1 \%$ per year and lenders require loans to be collateralized $102 \%$. What would be the dollar profit or loss to the short seller if $\mathrm{XYZ}$ rose to $\$ 103$ at the end of one year when the position was liquidated, and what is the effect of the dividend on that profit or loss? Assume that commission and other transaction fees totaled 5 cents per share.

First, the short position loses $\$ 3$ (a capital loss) when the stock rises from $\$ 100$ to $\$ 103$. When the stock pays dividends of $\$ 1$, it is up to the short seller to make a cash payment to the securities lender in lieu of dividends, so the short seller loses another $\$ 1$. Finally, an institutional short seller typically receives a short stock rebate; in this case, the rebate would be $\$ 1.02(1 \% \times \$ 102)$. The total loss is $\$ 3.08$ per share $(-\$ 3.00+\$ 1.02-\$ 1.00-\$ 0.10$ round trip commission).
