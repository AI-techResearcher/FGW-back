\section*{APPLICATION B}
Question : An investor is considering the purchase of a core real estate property that offers $\$ 350,000$ per year in net operating income. The investor's analysis of cap rates on similar properties finds an average cap rate of $7 \%$. What is the value of the property based on Equation 2 and the investor's estimates of the net operating income and appropriate cap rate?
