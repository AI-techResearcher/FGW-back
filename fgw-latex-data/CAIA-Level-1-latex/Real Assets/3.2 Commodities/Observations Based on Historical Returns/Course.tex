Observations Based on Historical Returns

Commodity returns are monthly returns observed from January of 2000 to December of 2021, for a total of 252 observations. The exhibit, Statistical Summary of Returns from the Commodity Risk Attributes lesson provides univariate return statistics in the top panel, partial autocorrelations of commodities in the middle panel, and a histogram of returns in the bottom panel.

Key observations on commodity returns that are consistent with economic reasoning are an essential component of knowledge and include the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Commodity returns had historic volatility moderately exceeding that of global equities.

  \item Commodity returns generated a negative Sharpe ratio.

  \item Commodity returns had moderate positive first-order autocorrelation.

  \item Commodity returns had a maximum calendar month loss of almost $30 \%$ (1.5 times that of global equities).

  \item Commodities experienced a massive maximum drawdown (i.e., about -85\%).

\end{enumerate}
