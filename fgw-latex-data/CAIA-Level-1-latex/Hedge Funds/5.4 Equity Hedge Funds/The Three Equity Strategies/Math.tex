\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : Suppose that a short seller establishes a short position in one share of XYZ Corporation at $\$ 50$ per share and that XYZ pays a dividend of $\$ 0.30$ per share each calendar quarter. The current rebate on XYZ shares is $1 \%$ per year. What would be the dollar return to the short seller if XYZ rose to $\$ 51$ at the end of one year?

\section*{Answer and Explanation}
First, the short position loses $\$ 1$ (a capital loss) when the stock rises from $\$ 50$ to $\$ 51$. When the stock pays four quarterly dividends of $\$ 0.30$, it is up to the short seller to make a cash payment to the securities lender in lieu of dividends, so the short seller loses another $\$ 1.20$. Finally, an institutional short seller typically receives a short stock rebate; in this case, the rebate would be $\$ 0.50(1 \% \times \$ 50)$. The total loss is $\$ 1.70(\$ 1.00+\$ 1.20-\$ 0.50)$.
