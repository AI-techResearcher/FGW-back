\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : What would be the short position in a four-year zero-coupon bond that would form a duration-neutral hedge with a $\$ 2$ million long position in a bond with a duration of 2.5 ?

\section*{ Answer and EXPLANATION}
To find the short position in a four-year zero-coupon bond that would form a duration-neutral hedge with a $\$ 2$ million long position in a bond with a duration of 2.5, we need to divide the long bond position duration by the short bond position duration and multiply by the nominal amount of the position that needs to be hedged. In this application, we need to divide 2.5 (duration of long bond position) by 4.0 (duration of short bond position) and multiply the quotient by $\$ 2,000,000$ (size of long position, which is the position being hedged) for a short bond position of $\$ 1,250,000$.

\section*{APPLICATION B}
Question : A prepayable mortgage has an option-adjusted spread of 50 basis points. Analysis indicates that 70 basis points of the prepayable mortgage yield is attributable to the prepayment option. If the prepayable mortgage has a yield of $6.00 \%$, what is the yield on a comparable treasury security?

\section*{ Answer and EXPLANATION}
To find the yield on a comparable treasury security, we simply have to manipulate Equation 1:

Prepayable Mortgage Yield = Treasury Yield + OAS + Spread Due to Prepayment Option

Treasury Yield = Prepayable Mortgage Yield - OAS - Spread Due to Prepayment Option

Treasury Yield $=6.00 \%-0.50 \%-0.70 \%=4.80 \%$
