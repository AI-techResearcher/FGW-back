\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : ABC Corp. has offered to purchase DEF Corp. for \$25 per share. Immediately before the merger proposal announcement, DEF was trading at \$18 per share. Immediately after the announcement, DEF is trading at $\$ 23$ per share. Assuming that the share price of DEF would fall to $\$ 16$ if the deal fails and that the riskless interest rate is 0\%, describe a long position in DEF taken by an event-driven hedge fund both as a combination of positions in a risk-free bond and a binary call option and as a combination of positions including a binary put option.

\section*{Answer and Explanation}
The hedge fund's position may be viewed as a long position in a riskless bond with a face value of $\$ 16$ and a long position in a binary call option with a potential payout of $\$ 9$ in case the merger is successful and shares of DEF rise to $\$ 25$ per share. The hedge fund may also be viewed as a long position in a riskless bond with a face value of $\$ 25$ and a short position in a binary put option with a potential payout of $\$ 9$ in case the merger is not successful and shares of DEF decline to $\$ 16$ per share.
