\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : Prior to a merger announcement, MegaStock, trading at $\$ 102$, plans to offer one share of MegaStock for 3.5 shares of MiniStock, trading at $\$ 20$. After the announcement, MegaStock trades at $\$ 100$, MiniStock jumps to $\$ 25$, and an arbitrageur takes a traditional and hedged merger arbitrage position. Ignoring transaction costs, interest, and dividends, how much money would the arbitrageur earn per share of MegaStock if the merger consummates, and how much money would be lost if the deal fails and the prices revert to their preannouncement levels?

\section*{Answer and Explanation}
The short position in one share of MegaStock generates proceeds of $\$ 100$. Buying 3.5 shares of MiniStock costs $\$ 87.50$. If the deal goes through, the arbitrageur pockets the $\$ 12.50$ net proceeds as profit and delivers the exchanged shares to cover the short. If the deal fails, the arbitrageur sells the 3.5 shares at $\$ 20$ for $\$ 70$ in proceeds, buys back MegaStock at $\$ 102$, and expends $\$ 32$, which is a $\$ 19.50$ loss after netting the proceeds of $\$ 12.50$.
