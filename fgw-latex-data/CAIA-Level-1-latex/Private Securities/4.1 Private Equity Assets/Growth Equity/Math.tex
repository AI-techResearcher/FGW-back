\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : A potential growth equity investment has projected annual revenues of $\$ 80$ million in six years, at which point an IPO is anticipated sublicly traded firms have enterprise-value-to-revenue multiples of 2.25. The firm seeks growth equity financing and offers a $25 \%$ stake in the company. Based on Equation 1 and ignoring any cash or debt in the existing firm, determine the estimated value of the growth equity if the required IRR is $45 \%$.

\section*{Answer and Expanation}
To solve the first part of this problem, we should use Equation 1. Note how similar this equation is to Equation 1:

$$
\text { Value of Venture }=\frac{\text { Revenue } \times \text { Revenue Multiple }}{(1+I R R)^{T}}
$$

By multiplying the projected EBITDA by a multiple, the numerator of this equation represents the investment value in seven years, or $\$ 200$ million. We then have to discount this investment value back to the present value using the investment's internal rate of return (IRR), which is $65 \%$.

$$
\text { Value of Venture }=\frac{\$ 80 \text { million } \times 2.25}{1.45^{6}}=\$ 19.37 \text { million }
$$

Now that we have determined the total value of the enterprise, all we must do is determine the value of a $25 \%$ stake in the firm. This is done by multiplying $25 \%$ by $\$ 19.37$ million, or $\$ 4.84$ million.
