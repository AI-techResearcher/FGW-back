\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : Shares of closed-end fund ABC were selling at a premium of $10 \%$ and then fell to $\$ 44$ per share while ABC's net asset value held constant at $\$ 50$ per share. What were the previous market price, subsequent discount, NAV-based return, and market-price return for $A B C$ ?

\section*{Answer and Explanation}
The previous market price was $\$ 55$ (solved using Equation 1, with 0.10 on the left-hand side and $\$ 50$ for the NAV). The subsequent discount (solved as $-12 \%$ using Equation 1 , with $\$ 44 / \$ 50$ as the fraction inside the parentheses) was $12 \%$. The NAV-based return was $0 \%$, since the NAV was assumed unchanged, and the marketprice return was $-20 \%(-\$ 11 / \$ 55)$, assuming no dividends or other distributions.
