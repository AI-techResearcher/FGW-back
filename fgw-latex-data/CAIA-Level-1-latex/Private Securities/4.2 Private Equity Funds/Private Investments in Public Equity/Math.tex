\section*{APPLICATION A}
A convertible preferred stock with a par or face value of $\$ 100$ per share is convertible into four shares of common stock. What is the conversion ratio, and what is the conversion price? What would be the conversion ratio if the conversion price were $\$ 20$ ?

\section*{Answer and Explanation}
The original example of the preferred stock has a conversion ratio of 4:1. The conversion option may be expressed as a conversion price of $\$ 25$ (using the face value of the preferred stock to make the purchase). In the second example of a $\$ 20$ conversion price, the conversion ratio would be 5:1.
