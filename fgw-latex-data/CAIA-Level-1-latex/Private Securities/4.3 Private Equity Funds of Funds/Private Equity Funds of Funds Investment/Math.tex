\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : An investor plans to make a $\$ 20$ million investment into a PE FoF. The investor will hold the investment for 10 years and the underlying portfolio of PE funds is expected to achieve an IRR of $10 \%$ over the period. Assume that the PE FoF will charge an annual management fee of $1.0 \%$ on commitment capital, and a carry of $10 \%$ over an $8 \%$ hurdle.

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the total fee paid to the FoF GP? For simplicity, assume that the capital commitment will be fully drawn from day one, instead of being drawn over a typical two- to three-year period.
  \item What is the total fee as a percentage to investor's capital commitment?
  \item Assuming that an in-house fund selection team costs $\$ 600$ k per year, should the investor allocate to the FoF, or build an in-house team?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Answer and explanation}
Total fee paid to the PE FoF GP is $\$ 5$ million.

The total fee paid as a percentage of the investor's commitment is $25 \%$, or an average $2.5 \%$ p.a. over the period.

Since the expected annual fee paid to the FoF ( $\$ 500 \mathrm{k}$ ) is lower than the cost of an in-house team ( $\$ 600 \mathrm{k}$ ), the investor could consider allocating to the Fo as a more cost-effective option.
