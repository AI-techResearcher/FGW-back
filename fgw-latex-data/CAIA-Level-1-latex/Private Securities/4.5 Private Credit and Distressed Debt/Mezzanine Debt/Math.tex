\section*{APPLICATION A}
Question : Suppose that the structure on the right-hand side of the exhibit Mezzanine Financing and the Cost of Capital is changed such that the mezzanine debt rises to being $30 \%$ of the capital structure, and the bank debt falls to being $50 \%$ of the capital structure. If the costs of bank debt and equity remain the same $(8 \%$ and $32 \%$, respectively), what must the new cost of mezzanine debt be such that the weighted average cost of capital would be 15.8\%?

\section*{Answer and explanation}
Let's manipulate the WACC equation to solve for the cost of mezzanine debt:

$$
\begin{gathered}
W A C C=C_{a} \times P_{a}+C_{b} \times P_{b}+C_{c} \times P_{c} \\
W A C C-C_{b} \times P_{b}-C_{c} \times P_{c}=C_{a} \times P_{a} \\
\frac{W A C C-C_{b} \times P_{b}-C_{c} \times P_{c}}{P_{a}}=C_{a}
\end{gathered}
$$

After manipulating the equation, we can now solve for the cost of mezzanine debt:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{0.158-0.32 \times 0.20-0.08 \times 0.50}{0.30}=C_{a} \\
\frac{0.158-0.064-0.04}{0.30}=C_{a} \\
\frac{0.054}{0.30}=C_{a} \\
0.18=C_{a}
\end{gathered}
$$

The cost of mezzanine debt is 0.18 or $18 \%$.
