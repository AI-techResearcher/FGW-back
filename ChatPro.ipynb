Systematic trading in this context \\nrefers to the automation of the investment process, not to systematic risk. Systematic trading models apply a fixed set of tr ading rules in determining when to enter  \\nand exit positions.  Deviation  from the system's  rules is generally  not permitted.  \\n \\nDerivation  of Systematic  Trading  Rules \\nSystematic  trading  rules are generally  derived  from backtests.  In the context  of systematic  trading  rules,  a backtest  is an identification  of a price or return  pattern \\nthat appears  to persist,  as located  and verified  through  a quantitative  analysis  of historical  prices.  Trading  systems  are generally  based  on the expectation  that \\nhistorical  price patterns  will recur in the future.  However,  many  trading  systems  that appear  to perform  well using backtested  data end up performing  poorly  when \\nthey are implemented  in real time.  Statistics  show that when  many  analysts  search  through  many  data sets with many  hypothetical  trading  systems,  very many \\ntrading  systems  appear  ex post to be profitable  but in fact are generated  purely  by randomness  or by market  regimes  that no longer  exist.  Being  able to avoid data \\ndredging  and false identification  of attractive  trading  rules is the key to successful  backtesting.  \\nBacktests  should  also have reasonable  estimates  for transaction  costs and slippage.   is the unfavorable  difference  between  assumed  entry  and exit prices \\nand the entry and exit prices  experienced  in practice.  Thus,  an analyst  observing  a long history  of daily closing  prices  should  assume  that an actual  trading  strategy  is \\nlikely to generate  less favorable  price executions  due to the tendency  of buy orders  to push prices  up, or be executed  at an offer price,  and of sell orders  to push \\nprices  down,  or be executed  at a bid price.  Care should  also be taken  to ensure  that reported  prices  on which  backtests  are performed  are executable  prices  rather \\nthan stale prices  or published  indications  of prices,  and that they are free from large errors.  Systematic  traders  rarely  employ  only a single  trading  system  with a \\nsingle  security.  \\nManagers  who have success  with one trading  system  in one market  typically  search  for other  markets  in which  that trading  system,  or a modified  version  of it, can be \\nsuccessfully  applied.  Over time,  managers  may modify  their trading  systems,  develop  new ones,  and abandon  others.  \\n \\nThree  Questions  in Evaluating  a Systematic  Trading  System  \\nThere  are three  useful  questions  to ask when  evaluating  an individual  trading  strategy:  \\n \\n1. What is the trading  system,  and how was it developed?  Here,  one is looking  to understand  the broad  underlying  trading  approach  (e.g.,  trend  following  versus \\ncountertrend)  and specific  characteristics  of the strategy  itself.  It is also important  to understand  the research  methods  used to identify  and develop  the \\ntrading  strategy  to avoid strategies  based  on spurious  results  from data dredging.  Poor research  methods  can lead to overfitting  of historical  data, such that a \\nhistorical  price series  may appear  to have a recurring  pattern  yet be in fact random.  \\n2. Why and when  does the trading  system  work,  and why and when  might  it not work?  It is important  to understand  the underlying  hypothesis  of a specific \\ntrading  strategy.  If the trading  system  is making  money  for its investors,  from where  or from whom  is that money  coming?  Such understanding  is important  in \\nand of itself but is also critical  in identifying  market  conditions  that are likely to be supportive  of the strategy  (e.g.,  trend  accompanied  by low volatility). \\nAlthough  it may be difficult  to forecast  market  conditions,  understanding  what impact  various  market  conditions  are likely  to have on the strategy's \\nperformance  is important  in interpreting  the potential  success  or failure  of a strategy  over time.  \\n3. How is the trading  system  implemented?  Many operational  factors  contribute  to a successful  systematic  trading  strategy,  including  selection  of data sources, \\ndetermination  of periodicity  of data, establishment  of protocols  to clean  the data, processing  of the data into a trading  signal,  placement  of trades,  record \\nkeeping,  and broker  reconciliation.  \\nThe key to systematic trading systems is to differentiate spurious results from results that will persist. Similarly, analyst s seek to ascertain whether trading systems  \\nthat were successful in the past but have stopped working recently will perform poorly on a temporary basis or on a permanent  basis. In other words, at what point \\nshould  a trading  system  be abandoned  or modified  if the system  worked  very well in the past but has generated  poor results  recently?  \\n \\nValidation  and Potential  Degradation  of Systematic  Trading  Rules \\nSystematic  managed  futures  strategies  rely on quantitative  research  methods  that backtest  trading  rules using historical  price data.  of a trading  rule refers \\nto the use of new data or new methodologies  to test a trading  rule developed  on another  set of data or with another  methodology.  For example,  a trading  rule \\ndeveloped  analyzing  data during  five calendar  years  should  be tested  first in subperiods  of those  five years  to see if the results  are robust  across  data sets and sub- \\nintervals.  refers  to the reliability  with which  a model  or system  developed  for a particular  application  or with a particular  data set can be successfully \\nextended  into other  applications  or data sets. Most important,  validation  of the trading  rule should  be performed  with out-of-sample  data.  are \\nobservations  that were not directly  used to develop  a trading  rule or even indirectly  used as a basis for knowledge  in the research.  For example,  the trading  rule \\nshould  be validated  on the most recent  data,  which,  of course,  should  not have been used explicitly  or implicitly  in the model's  development.   are \\nthose  observations  directly  used in the backtesting  process.  Out-of-sample  data consist  of more recent  data than were used in the backtest.  Out-of-sample  data \\nshould  be used to test the profitability  of a trading  strategy  beyond  the period  covered  by the backtest.  The goal is to avoid  data dredging  and to ensure  that a \\ntrading  rule generates  persistent  performance.  \\nFurther, it is vital to know how many trading rules were tested, how many were subjected to validation, and how many were rej ected in the validation process. If 20  \\ntrading  rules (e.g.,  one model  with 20 different  parameter  values)  are subjected  to validation,  one of them on average  will survive  a validation  process  with a \\nconfidence  interval  of 95%, even if none of the rules truly offers  value -added  properties.  More to the point,  if several  analysts  test hundreds  of strategies  (e.g., \\nhundreds  of parameter  values)  on numerous  data sets (e.g.,  securities),  then numerous  trading  strategies  will survive  the validation  process  unless  the validation \\nprocess  is carefully  designed  to incorporate  into its statistical  approach  the total number  of tests performed.  \\nTrading  rules typically  evolve  over time as analysts  try to optimize  profitability.  Analysts  perform  ongoing  research  to estimate  and refine  trading  parameters,  add \\nnew trading  parameters,  and drop old trading  parameters.  Markets  also typically  evolve  over time.  A once-profitable  price pattern  that becomes  identified  and \\nexploited  by numerous  CTAs eventually  ceases  to exist or substantially  changes.  Therefore,  a trading  model  or trading  strategy  that has been successful  over the past \\n\", metadata={'source': '/Users/alphatech/Desktop/Educational web app/fgwpro-main2/DataTheory/CAIA Level 1/CAIA Level 1/Hedge Funds/5.2 Macro and Managed Futures Funds/Systematic Trading/course.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content=\" \\n \\n10 years often  experiences  degradation  and is not profitable  over the next 10 years.  In this context,   is the tendency  and process  through  time by which  a \\ntrading  rule or trading  system  declines  in effectiveness.  The key is to differentiate  between  (1) trading  rules that are being  changed  to better  identify  true price \\npatterns,  and (2) trading  rules that are data dredging  for a pattern  that no longer  exists.  Both an effective  trading  system  and a fully degraded  trading  system \\nexperience  episodes  of high returns  and episodes  of poor returns  due to randomness.  Identifying  which  systems  remain  effective  and which  have degraded  requires \\ncareful  statistical  analysis  as well as informed  qualitative  analysis.  \\n \\nSystematic  Trading  Strategies  Overview  \\n are generally  categorized  into three  groups:  trend -following,  non-trend -following,  and relative  value.  \\n are designed to identify and take advantage of momentum in price direction (i.e., trends in prices).   is the extent to which a  \\nmovement  in a security  price tends  to be followed  by subsequent  movements  of the same security  price in the same direction.  Trend -following  strategies  use recent \\nprice moves  over some specific  time period  (e.g.,  ranging  from a few minutes  to several  hundred  days) to identify  a price trend.  The goal is to establish  long positions \\nin assets  experiencing  an upward  trend,  establish  short positions  in assets  experiencing  a downward  trend,  and avoid  positions  in assets  not experiencing  a trend.  \\n refers  to the situation  in which  returns  show negative  autocorrelation —the opposite  tendency  of momentum  or trending.  An asset that consistently \\ntends  to return  toward  its previous  price level after a move  in one direction  is typically  said to be mean -reverting  or to exhibit  mean  reversion.  Mean reversion  is the \\nextent to which an asset's price moves toward the average of its recent price levels. Trending markets exhibit returns with p ositive autocorrelation. A price series with  \\nchanges  in its prices  that are independent  from current  and past prices  is a . Therefore,  momentum  and mean  reversion  are properties  that are not \\nconsistently  displayed  by prices  that follow  a random  walk.  \\n \\nSimple  Moving  Averages  in Systematic  Trading  Strategies  \\nOne of the most popular classes of trend -following strategies uses moving averages to signal trades. A  is a series  of averages  that is recalculated \\nthrough time based on a window of observations. The most basic approach uses a  , a simple  arithmetic  average  of previous  prices.  More \\nsophisticated  averaging  techniques  place  a greater  weight  on more recent  prices.  The formula  for calculating  a simple  moving  average,  SMAt(n), is shown  in Equation \\n1, where  t is the current  time period  and n is the number  of time periods  used in the computation:  \\n \\n \\nThe window  of observations  is composed  of a fixed number  of lagged  prices.  For example,  a current  10-day moving  average  price (day 0) is formed  using the 10 prices \\ncorresponding to the 10 days immediately preceding the current price (days −1 to −10). Yesterday's (day −1) 10-day moving average would be composed of the prices \\ncorresponding  to the 10 days prior to that day (days −2 to −11). The next exhibit,  Simple  Moving  Average  Summary  summarizes  the process  along  with the classic \\ntrading  signals  based  on a simple  trend  following  rule. \\nSimple  Moving  Average  Summary  \\nDescription:  In a simple  moving  average,  the daily prices  are equally  weighted.  As each new price observation  is added  to the series,  the oldest  observation  falls away,  \\ncreating  a window  of averaged  prices  that is often  charted.  \\nSignals:  Enter  long if current  price Pt > SMAt(n) \\nEnter  short if current  price Pt < SMAt(n) \\n \\nLike the underly ing market  itself,  the moving  average  price changes  every  day, but the moving  average  changes  value  in a lagged  and muted  fashion  relative  to the \\ncurrent  price.  The shorter  the time period  used to calculate  the moving  average,  the more quickly  the average  will respond  to changes  in the level of more current \\nprices, the more volatile the average will be, and, generally, the more times the current price will cross over the moving av erage price (i.e., the more trading signals \\nwill be generated).  \\nNumerous  variations  of moving  average  computations  exist:  \\n \\n The number  of periods  (and the length  of the time period)  used in the moving  average,  n, can vary (e.g.,  10-day versus  30-day versus  60-minute). \\n The entry and exit levels  can be a percentage  of the moving  average  (e.g.,  enter  when  the current  price exceeds  the moving  average  by 1%). \\n An unequally  weighted  moving  average  can be calculated,  using an averaging  process  that weights  recent  prices  more heavily  than older prices.  \\n \\nThere  are trading  signals  other  than the comparison  of the current  price to a single  moving  average.  For example,  trading  signals  to establish  long positions  may be \\nidentified  as follows:  \\n When  the current  price exceeds  two or more moving  averages  (e.g.,  both the 10-day and the 30-day moving  averages) \\n When  a shorter -term moving  average  crosses  up and over a longer -term moving  average  \\n\", metadata={'source': '/Users/alphatech/Desktop/Educational web app/fgwpro-main2/DataTheory/CAIA Level 1/CAIA Level 1/Hedge Funds/5.2 Macro and Managed Futures Funds/Systematic Trading/course.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content=\" \\n   When moving  averages  align upward  (i.e., are all in the same direction,  with the shorter  moving  averages  exceeding  the longer  moving  averages)  \\nThe three  computational  variations  taken  together  with the various  signal  identification  rules generate  an astounding  number  of possible  strategies.  The abundance \\nof potential  strategies  leads to the potential  problem  of data dredging,  in which  so many  potential  strategies  can be tested  that strategies  will be identified  that \\nsatisfy empirical tests with high levels of statistical confidence even when true patterns do not exist. There are two major approaches to weighting more recent prices  \\nmore heavily  than older prices:  weighted  moving  averages  and exponential  moving  averages.  \\n \\nWeighted  and Exponential  Moving  Averages  in Systematic  Trading  Strategies  \\nAlthough  simple  moving  averages  are the most commonly  used measures,  weighted  and exponential  moving  averages  are also used and have the potential \\nadvantage  of assigning  larger  weights  to the most recent  prices.  \\n \\nA  is usually  formed  as an unequal  average,  with weights  arithmetically  declining  from most recent  to most distant  prices.  To illustrate,  the \\nlength  of the averaging  interval  (i.e., the number  of observations  used in the computation  of each average)  is denoted  as n. The oldest  price is multiplied  by 1, the \\nsecond  oldest  price is multiplied  by 2, and so forth,  until the most recent  price is multiplied  by n. Each product  is then divided  by the sum of the digits.  The n-period \\nweighted  moving  average,  WMA t(n), is shown  in Equation  2: \\n \\nDefine  N = 1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ + n \\nn n−1 1 (2) \\nWMA t(n) = N pt−1 + N pt−2 + ⋯ + N pt−n \\nIn the case of n = 4, the sum of the labels, N, is 10 (the sum of 1 through 4). The most recent previous price ( Pt−1) is weighted 40% (4/10), the second most recent price \\nis weighted  30% (3/10),  and so forth,  until the oldest  price is weighted  only 10% (1/10).  Note that the weights  decline  arithmetically:  40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%. \\nThe  is a geometrically  declining  moving  average  based  on a weighted  parameter,  λ, with 0 < λ < 1. The most recent  observation  is \\nweighted  through  multiplication  by the weighted  parameter,  λ. All other  previous  observations  are weighted  by λ (1 − λ)n, in which  n is the length  of the time lag. For \\nexample,  with λ = 0.4, the most recent  observation  is multiplied  by 0.4. The second  and third most recent  observations  are weighted  by λ (1 − λ)1 and λ (1 − λ)2 (0.24 and \\n0.144),  respectively.  The formula  for the exponential  moving  average  at time t, EMAt(λ), is given next in an expanded  form (Equation  3a) and a reduced  form \\n(Equation  3b): \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\nEquation 3a illustrates the intuition of the exponential moving average. The most recent price receives the weighted paramete r, λ. The terms after the first term are \\nmultiplied  both by λ and by (1 − λ)n. Since (1 − λ) is less than 1, the weight  assigned  to each previous  price declines  as the price becomes  more distant.  The problem with \\nEquation  3a is that to compute  EMAt(λ) using that equation  requires  input of the entire  history  of the price series.  \\nEquation  3b denotes  how the exponential  moving  average  is calculated  in practice.  In this view,  today's  exponential  moving  average  is a weighted  average  of the \\ncurrent  price and yesterday's  exponential  moving  average.  Inspection  of either  equation  reveals  that the formula  requires  an infinitely  long history  of previous  prices. \\nTherefore,  in practice,  computation  is performed  by seeding  some initial  value  to EMAt−1. Once an initial  approximation  is set for a previous  value  of the exponential \\nmoving  average,  all subsequent  exponential  moving  averages  are simply  computed  as the sum of λ times  the most recent  price (1 − λ) times  the most recent exponential  \\nmoving  average.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nEMA t(λ) = λPt−1 + λ(1 − λ)Pt−2 + λ(1 − λ)2Pt−3 + λ(1 − λ)3Pt−4 + ⋯ \\nEMA t(λ) = (λ × Pt−1) + [(1 − λ) × EMA t−1(λ)] \", metadata={'source': '/Users/alphatech/Desktop/Educational web app/fgwpro-main2/DataTheory/CAIA Level 1/CAIA Level 1/Hedge Funds/5.2 Macro and Managed Futures Funds/Systematic Trading/course.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content=\" \\n \\n \\nAn Illustration  of a System  Using  Two Moving  Averages  \\nThe next exhibit  illustrates  a strategy  employing  two moving  averages  to generate  trading  signals.  In the example,  the strategy  uses a 10-day and a 45-day moving \\naverage as the shorter -term and the longer -term indicators, respectively. The first signal in the example (denoted with a vertical line) is a sell signal (i.e., a signa l to \\nestablish  a short position),  because  the 10-day moving  average  line (the shorter  average)  crossed  below  the 45-day moving  average  line (the longer  average).  Some \\ndays later,  a signal  to establish  a long position  emerged  when  the 10-day moving  average  line crossed  above  the 45-day moving  average  line. \\n \\n \\nExample  with Two Moving  Averages  appears  to illustrate  a highly  successful  trading  period  with two sell signals  at prices  much  higher  than the buy signal.  Trend - \\nfollowing  strategies  perform  well when  there  is an extended  move  in the price from one level to another,  and tend to be more powerful  when  that move  is \\naccompanied  by low daily price volatility.  This low volatility  makes  it less likely that the trend -following  manager  will be whipsawed.   is when  a trader \\nalternates  between  establishing  long positions  immediately  before  price declines  and establishing  short positions  immediately  before  price increases  and, in so \\ndoing,  experiences  a sequence  of losses.  In trend -following  strategies,  whipsawing  results  from a sideways  market.  A  exhibits  volatility  without  a \\npersistent  direction.  The above  exhibit  contains  several  regions  in which  whipsawing  may take place.  Midway  between  the starting  point and the first indicated  trade \\nsignal  are two instances  where  the two moving  averages  appear  to touch  and then return  to their previous  relationship.  When  trading  signals  are clustered, \\nwhipsawing  generally  takes  place,  and traders  lose from the accompanying  back-and-forth price pattern  as well as the trading  costs (bid-ask spreads  and \\ncommissions).  \\nVisual  exhibits  with discrete  prices  tend to mask the potential  for whipsawing  and its trading  costs.  Also, when  a market  price consistently  reverts  toward  previous \\nvalues  (i.e., is mean -reverting),  trend -following  strategies  tend to generate  negative  alphas.  The primary  challenge  of implementing  a moving  average  strategy  is \\nforecasting  when  markets  are likely to trend,  meaning  the strategy  should  be applied,  and forecasting  when  markets  are likely  to be random  or to mean -revert, \\nmeaning  the strategy  should  not be applied.  Thus,  implementation  of moving  average  strategies  focuses  on developing  methods  of determining  when  to apply  the \\nstrategy  in addition  to specifying  which  particular  moving  average  strategy  to apply.  There  has been considerable  academic  debate  over the viability  of trend - \\nfollowing  strategies.  \\n \\nBreakout  Strategies  \\n focus on identifying  the commencement  of a new trend  by observing  the range  of recent  market  prices  (e.g.,  looking  back at the range  of prices \\nover a specific  time period).  If the current  price is below  all prices  in the range,  the strategy  identifies  this as a breakout  and possibly  the beginning  of a downward \\ntrend,  and a short position  is initiated.  Breakout  strategies  lead to long trade  entry points  when  prices  break  above  these  ranges.  If a price is within  the range,  then \\nthe system  might  continue  to hold the previous  position  or no position  at all. The concept  can apply  to both prices  and volatilities,  and these  are often  used in \\ntandem.  Channel  Breakout  Strategy  Summary  describes  a simple  channel  breakout  strategy.  \\n \\nChannel  Breakout  Strategy  Summary  \\nThe simplest  way to think of this is in terms  of a look-back.  For example,  a 20-day look-back means  that the trading  system  observes  today's  price in relation  to all \\nprices  over the past 20 days.  The next exhibit  provides  a summary.  \\nDescription:  Channels  are created  by plotting  the range  of new price highs and lows. When  one side grows  disproportionately  to the other,  a trend  is revealed.  \\nSignals:  Buy when  channel  breaks  upward.  \\n Sell when  channel  breaks  downward.

Empirical  analysis  by Fung and Hsieh  confirms  that trend  following  is the dominant  style employed  by CTAs.  William  Fung and David  Hsieh,  “Empirical \\nCharacteristics  of Dynamic  Trading  Strategies:  The Case of Hedge  Funds,”  Review  of Financial  Studies  10, no. 2 (April  1997):  275–302. \\nLhabitant explains two drawbacks of trend -following systems based on moving average rules.  FranÇois -Serge Lhabitant, Hedge Funds: Origine, Strategies, \\nPerformance  (Paris:  Dunod,  2008).  First, they are slow to recognize  the beginning  or end of trends.  That is, an entry signal  occurs  after the trend  has already  been in \\neffect  for a while  and profits  have been missed,  and the exit signal  occurs  after the trend  has reversed  and losses  have occurred.  The second  drawback  is that moving \\naverage  rules are designed  to exploit  trends  or momentum  that should  not persist  in competitive  markets.  Perfect  competition  causes  randomness  rather  than \\ntrending in price. But even at modest levels of competition, trends may cease to exist at approximately the same time that th ey become easily identified. In this case, \\nmoving  average  rules tend to generate  useless  and costly  signals;  that is, the trader  may end up incurring  substantial  transaction  costs and being  whipsawed.  \\nSome  observers  have described  trend -following  strategies  as long volatility  strategies.  The idea is that trend -following  strategies  profit  when  market  prices  make \\nlarge unidirectional  changes  and that large unidirectional  changes  generate  higher  reported  volatility,  as indicated  by some measures  of volatility.  However,  large \\nunidirectional  changes  can also be consistent  with low volatility.  For example,  a prolonged  period  of consistently  positive  daily or weekly  returns  compounds  into \\nlarge monthly  returns  and a large unidirectional  change.  But the standard  deviation  of the daily or weekly  returns  will be low if most of the returns  are near the mean \\nreturn.  Thus,  depending  on how volatility  is viewed  or measured,  trend -following  systems  may or may not be accurately  described  as being  long volatility.  \\nMalek  and Dobrovolsky  provide  an extended  discussion  of the volatility  exposure  of managed  futures  programs.  Marc H. Malek  and Sergei  Dobrovolsky,  “Volatility \\nExposure  of CTA Programs  and Other  Hedge  Fund Strategies,”  Journal  of Alternative  Investments  11, no. 4 (2009):  68–89. Rather  than describing  CTAs as managers \\nwho take long volatility  positions,  Malek  and Dobrovolsky  assert  that a better  view is that CTAs take long gamma  positions.  Gamma  is more completely  discussed  in \\nthe session,  Event -Driven  and Relative  Value  Hedge  Funds.  In this context,  gamma  refers  to the risk exposure  from increasing  long positions  in rising markets  and \\ndecreasing  short  positions  in falling  markets.  \\nManaged  futures  programs  can benefit  when  markets  trade  in wide ranges,  making  prolonged  moves  between  levels  that vary substantially.  Trend -following \\nprograms  struggle  to profit  when  markets  trade  in narrow  ranges  and exhibit  negative  autocorrelation.  Predicting  those  markets  that will consistently  experience \\ntrends,  and identifying  when  those  markets  are going  to trend —and when  they will not trend —is the goal of many  CTAs and the source  of alpha.  \\n \\nNon-Trend -Following  Strategies  \\nNon-trend -following  strategies  are designed  to exploit  nonrandomness  in market  movements,  such as a pattern  of relative  moves  in prices  of related  commodities \\n(e.g.,  oil and gasoline).  Non-trend -following  strategies  generally  fall into the major  categories  of countertrend  or pattern  recognition.   use \\nvarious  statistical  measures,  such as price oscillation  or a relative  strength  index,  to identify  range -trading  opportunities  rather  than price-trending  opportunities. \\nThe , sometimes  called  the relative  strength  indicator,  is a signal  that examines  average  up and down  price changes  and is designed  to \\nidentify  trading  signals  such as the price level at which  a trend  reverses  (See next exhibit,  Relative  Strength  Index  (RSI)).  The formula  for RSI is shown  in Equation  4. \\n \\n \\nwhere  U = average  of all price changes  for each period  with positive  price changes  for the last n periods,  D = average  of all price changes  (expressed  as absolute \\nvalues)  for each period  with negative  price changes  for the last n periods,  and n = number  of periods  (most  commonly,  n = 14 days).  \\nRelative  Strength  Index (RSI) \\n \\nDescription:  The RSI is an oscillator  based  on an index  of 0 (a market  low) to 100 (a market  high),  with 50 being  neutral.  The RSI attempts  to determine  the relative \\nmarket  strength  of the current  price.  To do this, the RSI compares  the average  price change  for each period  having  a positive  price change  with the \\naverage  price change  for each period  having  a negative  price change.  \\nSignals:  Establish  long position  when  RSI < 30 (oversold  market).  \\nEstablish  short position  when  RSI > 70 (overbought  market).  \\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/alphatech/Desktop/Educational web app/fgwpro-main2/DataTheory/CAIA Level 1/CAIA Level 1/Hedge Funds/5.2 Macro and Managed Futures Funds/Systematic Trading/course.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content=' \\n \\nAn example  of applying  the RSI is summarized  in the next exhibit,  Relative  Strength  Index  (RSI);  Sometimes  Termed  Relative  Strength  Indicator.  The RSI is a simple \\nform of a pattern  recognition  system.  A  looks to capture  non-trend -based  predictable  abnormal  market  behavior  in prices  or volatilities. \\nThe RSI can be implemented  with any periodicity  or unit of time.  The periodicity,  N, is defined  as days, and the number  of periods  is often  set at 14 days. But the \\nperiodicity  can be expressed  in hours,  in minutes,  or even in terms  of individual  price ticks;  the user sets the number  of periods.  \\n \\n \\nThe RSI trading  signals  are based  on numerical  levels.  When  an RSI is less than 30, the market  is typically  considered  oversold  (i.e., underpriced),  and a long position \\nis established.  When  its value  is more than 70, the market  is considered  overbought,  and a short position  is taken.  Relative  Strength  Index  (RSI);  Sometimes  Termed \\nRelative  Strength  Indicator  illustrates  the use of an RSI graphically  using hypothetical  data. As can be seen in the diagram,  the price of a futures  contract  declined \\nsharply  early in the series,  eventually  reaching  a level for which  the corresponding  RSI was less than 30, indicated  by the dark-shaded  area below  the 30% RSI \\nhorizontal line. At or below this level, the countertrend strategy would buy (i.e., go long) the futures contract and hold th e position (subject to other risk management  \\nrules in the strategy)  until the RSI moved  back into its midrange,  where  it might  be liquidated.  As prices  continued  to move  higher,  so did the RSI, eventually  reaching \\nlevels  associated  with an overbought  market.  The strategy  would  then signal  the trader  to establish  a short futures  position,  once again hoping  to liquidate  the \\nposition  when  the RSI returned  to its midrange.  \\nRelative  strength  index  applications  vary in terms  of the timing  of transactions.  For example,  a buy or entering  trade  might  be made  when  the RSI reaches  30 from \\nabove,  when  it returns  to 30 from below,  or even using more sophisticated  analysis  to select  a point while  the RSI is below  30. The above  exhibit  illustrates  basing  buy \\ndecisions  on when  the RSI reaches  30 from below  and sell decisions  when  the RSI reaches  70 from above.  \\nThe above  exhibit  portrays  a very successful  example  of using the RSI. Prolonged  downtrends  and uptrends  can generate  losses.  Non-trend -following  strategies  trade \\nfrequently,  usually  much  more often than do most trend -following  systems,  although  short-term trend -following  strategies  are likely  to have high turnover  as well. In \\nthe managed  futures  industry,  most countertrend  strategies  operate  within  a relatively  short time frame,  using periods  ranging  from minutes  to a few days. This \\nhigher  frequency  price sampling,  at least relative  to trend  followers,  more often  than not results  in substantially  higher  daily trading  volumes.  For instance,  many \\ntrend  followers  trade  between  1,000  and 2,000  contracts  annually  per $1 million  AUM, whereas  nontrend  managers  frequently  trade  5,000  or more contracts  per $1 \\nmillion  AUM.  \\n \\nRelative  Value  Strategies  and Technical  Analysis  \\nRelative  value  strategies  attempt  to capture  inefficient  short-term price divergences  between  two empirically  or theoretically  correlated  prices  or rates.  Technical \\nstrategies  commonly  applied  to prices  and rates can also be applied  to spreads  or ratios  between  prices  and rates in relative  value  strategies.  For example,  RSIs can \\nbe applied  to the price spread  between  related  assets,  such as the spread  between  the futures  price of corn and the futures  price of wheat.  \\nIn managed futures, relative value strategies focus on short time frames (e.g., measured in seconds to days) or long time fra mes (e.g., measured in months). Relative  \\nvalue  strategies  analyze  the correlation  structure  between  two or more futures  contracts  and attempt  to exploit  deviations  in prices  as individual  futures  contracts \\nrespond  differently  to new information  or to liquidity  imbalances.  \\nThe next exhibit illustrates a relative value futures trade. It depicts the price evolution of two contracts, A and B, which are assumed to be highly correlated (e.g., oil \\nand gasoline). Assume that earlier in the series, prior to the time period graphed in the next exhibit, the prices of both co ntracts behaved very similarly. However, as \\nillustrated  in the exhibit  below,  after reaching  an initial  low, the price of contract  A rose much  faster  than the price of contract  B. Relative  value  strategies  look to \\nexploit  the price gap that developed  between  these  two contracts  by selling  (i.e., going short)  contract  A and buying  (i.e., going long) contract  B when  the spread \\nbecomes  large relative  to past spreads.  The trade  is unwound  as the two price series  converge.  \\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/alphatech/Desktop/Educational web app/fgwpro-main2/DataTheory/CAIA Level 1/CAIA Level 1/Hedge Funds/5.2 Macro and Managed Futures Funds/Systematic Trading/course.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content=' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe relative value strategy does not directly rely on the separate behavior of either price series.

Now  we need to divide that sum by the sum of \\nthe multiples: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15. 1569/15 = 104.6 is the 5 -day weighted moving average on Day 0.  \\nLet's find the 5 -day weighted moving average on Day -1.

Trading rules evolve over time as analysts optimize profitability and adapt to changing market conditions.\\n\\nOverall, the key to successful systematic trading is differentiating between spurious results and persistent performance, and continuously validating and refining trading rules to adapt to evolving markets.',\n",
              " 'The text discusses the concept of degradation in trading rules and systems over a 10-year period, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between effective and degraded systems. It also introduces three categories of systematic trading strategies: trend-following, non-trend-following, and relative value. Trend-following strategies aim to identify and capitalize on price momentum, while mean reversion refers to assets returning to previous price levels. Moving averages are commonly used in trend-following strategies, with variations in calculation methods and trading signals. Different types of moving averages and trading signals are discussed, highlighting the importance of careful analysis in systematic trading strategies.',\n",
              " 'This text discusses moving averages in systematic trading strategies, focusing on weighted and exponential moving averages. It explains how weighted moving averages assign larger weights to more recent prices, with weights declining arithmetically. Exponential moving averages use a weighted parameter to assign weights to previous observations. The text provides equations for calculating both types of moving averages and explains the practical computation of exponential moving averages. It also highlights the potential problem of data dredging when testing multiple strategies.',\n",
              " 'The text discusses an illustration of a trading strategy using two moving averages, with buy and sell signals based on the crossing of the averages. It also mentions the importance of trend-following strategies in low volatility markets and the risks of whipsawing. Breakout strategies are also explained, focusing on identifying new trends based on recent market prices. The Channel Breakout Strategy is summarized as buying when the channel breaks upward and selling when it breaks downward, with a look-back period of 20 days. The text emphasizes the challenge of forecasting market trends and the academic debate over trend-following strategies.',\n",
              " 'The text discusses trend-following strategies in managed futures, which are the dominant strategy employed by CTAs. It highlights drawbacks of trend-following systems based on moving average rules, such as slow recognition of trends and potential useless signals in competitive markets. The text also mentions that trend-following strategies are sometimes described as long volatility strategies, but this may not always be accurate. Additionally, non-trend-following strategies, such as countertrend or pattern recognition, are designed to exploit nonrandomness in market movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is discussed as a signal used in non-trend-following strategies to identify trading opportunities. Overall, the goal of many CTAs is to predict markets that will consistently experience trends and identify when they will trend.',\n",
              " 'The text discusses the application of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in trading strategies. The RSI is a pattern recognition system that looks for abnormal market behavior in prices or volatilities. Trading signals are based on numerical levels, with values below 30 indicating an oversold market and values above 70 indicating an overbought market. The text provides an example of using the RSI graphically to make trading decisions based on when the RSI reaches certain levels. \\n\\nAdditionally, the text mentions relative value strategies in trading, which aim to capture short-term price divergences between correlated prices or rates. Technical analysis strategies, such as the RSI, can also be applied to spreads or ratios between prices and rates in relative value strategies. The text includes an example of a relative value futures trade using two highly correlated contracts. The trade involves selling one contract and buying the other when a price gap develops, and unwinding the trade as the prices converge.',\n",
              " 'The relative value strategy in managed futures trading does not depend on the individual behavior of two prices, but rather on the relationship between them. This strategy focuses on the relationship between price series A and price series B, rather than on their trending or mean reversion. Managed futures trading involves complex strategies with rules, filters, entries, exits, position sizing, and risk management.',\n",
              " 'The text discusses the calculation of simple moving average prices using 3-day and 10-day moving averages for a stock with 10 consecutive daily prices. On day 0, the 3-day moving average is found to be 104, while on days -2 and -1, the 3-day moving averages are 104 and 105 respectively. The 10-day moving average for day 0 is calculated to be 101.4. The interpretation of these moving averages suggests that a long position should have been established due to the price on day -1 moving above the recent 3-day moving averages. The key takeaway is that the simple moving average is calculated by summing the prices and dividing by the number of days in the moving average.',\n",
              " 'The five-day weighted moving average prices on days -1 and 0 are 104.6 and 103.4, respectively. The calculation involves multiplying the most recent daily price by 5, the second most recent by 4, and so on, then summing the products and dividing by the sum of the numbers 1 to 5. This method provides a weighted average that gives more importance to recent prices in the calculation.',\n",
              " 'The exponential moving average prices on days −1 and 0 using λ = 0.25 are 100.75 and 102.0625, respectively. These values are calculated based on the given stock prices for days −5 to −1 and the previous exponential moving average up to and including day −3. The calculation involves weighting the prices with the given λ value to determine the exponential moving averages for each day.',\n",
              " 'In this text, the question is posed about what price level signals a breakout and possibly a long position using 10 days of data as a trading range. The 10 consecutive daily high prices are provided, ranging from 100 to 104. It is determined that a price of 105 would signal a long position should be established, as it exceeds the range of past data. On the other hand, if the series represented low prices, a current price of 97 would signal a breakout on the downside and typically be interpreted as a sell signal. The Upper Bound is $104, and the Lower Bound is $98, with prices above or below these levels indicating potential trading signals.']"
